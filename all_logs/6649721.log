Upside targets for Nifty are seen at 15,300 and 15,450.Metals, real estate, cement and infra are the sectors in which investors should park their money in a phased manner.We expect mid-cap and small-cap indices to continue their outperformance over Nifty.Here are three buy calls for the next 3-4 weeks:Fortis Healthcare | Buy | LTP: Rs 185.85 | Target price: Rs 215 | Stop loss: Rs 168 | Upside: 16%There are few sessions left to complete the entire quarter and so far, this is the highest quarterly close for Fortis.There are good chances that it will confirm this breakout by sustaining above Rs 183 odd levels by the end of March.On the week ended March 5, 2021, this stock broke out from a bullish flag pattern on the weekly charts with higher volumes.It has been trading above all important moving averages. Indicators and oscillators like RSI, MACD and DMI have turned bullish on the short-term charts.Edelweiss Financial Services | LTP: Rs 85.75 | Target price: Rs 99 | Stop loss: Rs 77 | Upside: 15%This stock has taken out the crucial double top resistance placed at Rs 84 on the weekly charts.Volumes during the breakout remained significantly higher as compared to previous weeks. The primary trend of the stock has been bullish with higher tops and higher bottoms on the daily and weekly charts.The stock is placed above all important moving averages. Besides, mid-cap stocks from the NBFC and broking industry have started outperforming.Godrej Industries | LTP: Rs 503 | Target price: Rs 575 | Stop loss: Rs 455 | Upside: 14%This stock has broken out from bullish inverted head and shoulder patterns on the monthly charts.It has recently taken out the crucial double top resistance placed at Rs 483. Moving average and oscillator setup looks bullish on daily and weekly charts.(The author is Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities)Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not that of the website or its management.
