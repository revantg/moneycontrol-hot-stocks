As far as resistance is concerned, traders should not anticipate any target and should keep long positions with trailing stop loss basis.Here are three buy calls for the next 3-4 weeks:Century Textile | LTP: Rs 865 | Target price: Rs 970 | Stop loss: Rs 815 | Upside: 12%This stock has broken out from double top resistance of Rs 832 with rising volumes.Indicator and oscillator setup has been bullish on weekly charts. The short term moving averages are placed above medium to long term moving averages.It has been forming higher tops and higher bottoms on weekly and monthly charts.Moreover, the realty sector has been performing very well and this company has a good exposure in realty sector.VIP Industries | LTP: Rs 478.05 | Target price: Rs 538 | Stop loss: Rs 425 | Upside: 13%A downward sloping trendline breakout is seen on the weekly charts. In August, this stock saw a huge amount of volume building along with rising price.A bullish cup and handle pattern breakout is visible on the weekly charts.Though RSI has reached overbought zone, it has not shown any sign of negative divergence.Weekly MACD has been above signal and equilibrium line. The stock is placed above medium to long term moving averages, indicating bullish trend on all timeframes.Can Fin Homes | LTP: Rs 598.15 | Target price: Rs 675 | Stop loss: Rs 550 | Upside: 13%This stock has broken out from the last five sessions' price consolidation. It has also broken out from the bullish flag pattern on weekly charts.Price breakout is seen along with the jump in volumes.Indicator and oscillator setup has been bullish on weekly charts. The short term moving averages are placed above medium to long term moving averages.(The author is a technical research analyst at HDFC securities)Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not that of the website or its management.
