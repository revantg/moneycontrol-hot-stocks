Traders can accumulate the stock in the range of Rs 2,375-2,395.HDFC Life Insurance Company | LTP: Rs 693.85 | Target price: Rs 750 | Stop loss: Rs 650 | Upside: 8%Since March, this stock has been trading in a downward sloping channel as prices took a deep cut from Rs 746 to Rs 660.However, in the recent past, it has managed to take support at its 200-day exponential moving average on the daily timeframe and bounced back sharply once again to regain the momentum above its falling trendline of sloping channel.At the current juncture, the stock has formed a rounding bottom pattern on the daily interval with breakout seen above the key resistance level of Rs 690.On the technical front, the stock is also maintaining its higher bottom formation.
