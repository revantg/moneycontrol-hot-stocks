Traders can accumulate the stock in the range of Rs 3,325-Rs 3,335.Mahindra &amp;amp;amp; Mahindra (M&amp;amp;amp;M) | LTP: Rs 785.65 | Target price: Rs 864 | Stop loss: Rs 725 | Upside: 10%Since April 2021, this stock has been fluctuating in a broader range of Rs 720-Rs 820. It, however, has been firmly holding above its 200-day exponential moving average on the daily charts.The stock has been seen trading in a downward sloping channel with the formation of a lower bottom pattern on the short-term charts.However, this week, it has managed to give a breakout above the falling trendline of the channel.It has also formed an inverted head and shoulder pattern on the daily interval. The breakout above the neckline of the pattern formation can also be seen on charts which points towards the next upswing in the prices.Traders can accumulate the stock in the range of Rs 777-Rs 787.Cummins India | LTP: Rs 947.90 | Target price: Rs 1,055 | Stop loss: Rs 845 | Upside: 11%This stock can be seen consolidating in the broader range of Rs 780-Rs 930 for the last five months.This week, it has given a breakout after a prolonged consolidation and also tested its 52-week high.Rising volumes along with price action suggest that the rally may continue in the upcoming sessions as well.Additionally, the stock has also given a fresh breakout on the broader time interval charts as well with prices holding above their all-important moving averages.Traders can accumulate the stock in the range of Rs 925-Rs 945.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not that of the website or its management.
