Momentum oscillator RSI (14) is near 60 level which indicates positive momentum may continue.Container Corporation of India (Concor) | LTP: Rs 735.85 | Target price: Rs 795 | Stop loss: Rs 706 | Upside: 8%On the daily chart, this stock took support near its 21-day exponential moving average and bounced back with volume confirmation.Concor gave an inverted head and shoulder pattern breakout on the daily interval on September 2 and it has been able to close above its neckline support.It has sustained near its lifetime high which confirms the strong positive sentiments for the medium to long term.Due to the recent smart rally, it has been able to close above its 21 and 50- day exponential moving averages on the daily scale.Most indicators and oscillators have shown positive divergence with the higher high formation on the daily chart.HDFC Asset Management Company (AMC) | LTP: Rs 3,267.65 | Target price: Rs 3,560 | Stop loss: Rs 3,100 | Upside: 9%The momentum is likely to continue as depicted on the weekly charts. The price setup looks promising where a cup pattern is visible.On the indicators front, MACD line has shown a positive crossover on daily charts and the ADX is showing a reading of 19.60 with a rising trend.RSI is yet to enter into overbought territory, indicating an upside potential is still left for the stock.A falling trendline breakout is also visible, signalling that the trend on the downside has been arrested.On the moving average front, the stock is trading well above its 21-day exponential moving average.(The author is a technical analyst at Bonanza Portfolio)Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not that of the website or its management.
