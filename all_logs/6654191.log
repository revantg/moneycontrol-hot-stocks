Traders can accumulate the stock in the range of Rs 123 - Rs 125 for the upside target of Rs 141.(The author is Senior Technical Analyst at SMC Global Securities)Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not that of the website or its management.
