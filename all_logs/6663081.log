If the index sustains above this level, we might see it heading higher towards 15,336 (3-week high) and eventually 15,431 (all-time high).The long-term bullish trend remains intact but in the medium-term, we might see the index in a range between 14,460 to 15,431 levels.Here are three buy calls for the next 4-5 weeks:KEI Industries | LTP: Rs 508 | Target price: 672 | Stop loss: Rs 480 | Upside: 32%This stock has been forming a higher top higher bottom pattern on the monthly charts since June 2020 which shows that the long-term bullish trend of the stock is intact.This week, the stock has given a breakout of consolidation phase forming since December 2020.
