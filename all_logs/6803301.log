So, going ahead, we can expect the broader range of the Nifty to be between 14,500-13,550.MACD plotted on the weekly timeframe can be seen forming a bearish crossover and is moving towards the zero line, indicating the strong bullish trend has halted for the time being.The RSI is moving lower towards the 50 mark which indicates the presence of bearish momentum.Going ahead, 14,190 will act as a make-or-break level. If prices break below this level, we might see the index move lower towards 14,000, followed by 13,658 (38.2 percent retracement level of the rise from 10,791-15,431).On the upside, 14,630 (20-day SMA) is the level to watch out for.
