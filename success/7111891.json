The 15,670 levels in the coming sessions will act as a make-or-break level if the prices breach below this level we can expect the prices to move lower and test the 15,450 and 15,100 eventually.Our bearish view will be negated if the 15,915 mark is breached on the upside, and in that case, we can expect the index to move higher and test the 16,000-16,100 mark.Here is a list of top trading ideas&nbsp;for&nbsp;the next 3-4 weeks.
