Traders can accumulate the stock in the range of Rs 1,000-1,015 for the upside target of Rs 1,120.Maruti Suzuki India | LTP: Rs 7,085 | Target price: Rs 7,800 | Stop loss: Rs 6,600 | Upside: 10%Since the beginning of the year, this stock has been moving lower with the formation of a lower bottom pattern as prices fell below the 200-days exponential moving average in the recent past.However, it took support around Rs 6,400 and recovered sharply to regain momentum above its 200-days exponential moving average on the daily charts.At the current juncture, the stock has given almost a V-shape recovery, forming a higher high pattern on charts with closing above 200-days exponential moving average on both daily and weekly intervals.Traders can accumulate the stock in the range of Rs 7,050-7,090 for the upside target of Rs 7,800.Infosys | LTP: Rs 1,388.95 | Target price: Rs 1,500 | Stop loss: Rs 1,300 | Upside: 8%Last week, this stock gave a fresh breakout above Rs 1,375 after consolidating in a range of Rs 1,310-1,375 for nearly five weeks.However, after testing Rs 1,416, it witnessed a pullback towards Rs 1,390 once again. The breakout was observed with rising volumes which suggest the strength in the current trend.The prices are holding well above short and long-term moving averages as well. Traders can accumulate the stock in the range of Rs 1,375-1,390 for the upside target of Rs 1,500.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not that of the website or its management.
