Now after a prolonged consolidation of nearly six months, it has given a breakout above its key resistance level of Rs 600.On the daily charts, it is well-placed above its short and long-term moving averages. Traders can accumulate the stock in the range of Rs 608-618.Asian Paints | LTP: Rs 3,145.05 | Target price: Rs 3,550 | Stop loss: Rs 2,920 | Upside: 13%It has been maintaining its uptrend and seen trading in a rising channel on broader charts with the formation of the higher high and higher bottom.However, for the last one month, this stock has been fluctuating in a broader range of Rs 2,950-3,090 along with multiple supports on short-term intervals and at its key moving averages.At the current juncture, it has given a fresh breakout above the consolidation zone with larger volumes.The price-volume action with breakouts suggests a long build-up in the stock. Traders can accumulate the stock in the range of Rs 3,150-3,160.Havells India | LTP: Rs 1,097.95 | Target price: Rs 1,285 | Stop loss: Rs 995 | Upside: 17%After testing the level of Rs 1,231 in February, this stock took a breather and retraced towards Rs 1,000.Since then it has been fluctuating in a broader range of Rs 980-1,100. At the current juncture, this stock has formed a rounding bottom pattern on the daily charts.It has regained momentum above its important hurdle of Rs 1,100.
