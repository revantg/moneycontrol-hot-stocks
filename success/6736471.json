However, the last hour pullback action pulled the index higher and recovered some of the earlier losses.The index closed at 14,683.50 with a gain of 46 points (0.31 percent) while BSE Sensex gained 42 points (0.09 percent).This signifies that 14,500-14,400 still remains an important support zone to watch out for.Nifty has been broadly moving within 14,900-14,400, indicating sideways consolidation.For the last couple of sessions, it has been sustaining below the 20-day moving average at 14,786 and 50-day moving average at 14,789, indicating weakness as well as lack of confidence in market participants.The next higher levels to be watched are around 14,800-14,900. Any pullback towards 14,600-14,500 should be used as a buying opportunity.The daily RSI has turned sideways and any move above the 50 mark can improve the bullish momentum.Here are three buy calls for the next 2-3 weeks:Divi's Laboratories | LTP: Rs 3,686.50 | Target range: Rs 3,780-3,820 | Stop loss: Rs 3,640 | Upside: 4%On the daily chart, the stock has given a V-shape breakout at Rs 3,580 and closed above the same, indicating an upward breakout.This buying momentum was observed from 20-day,50-day and 100-day simple moving average support which remains a positive sign.The daily and weekly strength indicator RSI is placed positively which shows the rising strength of the stock.Cadila Healthcare | LTP: Rs 459.45 | Target price: Rs 480 | Stop loss: Rs 449 | Upside: 4%With the current close, the stock has decisively broken out its four months' down-sloping trendline resistance around Rs 442, indicating a trend reversal to upward.This breakout is accompanied by rising volumes which signals rising participation on the breakout.The stock is well placed above its 20, 50, 100 and 200-day simple moving averages which support positive bias for the short and medium-term.IG Petrochemicals | LTP: Rs 439.95 | Target price: Rs 480 | Stop loss: Rs 425 | Upside: 9%For the last 8-10 weeks, the stock has been hovering around its multiple support zone at Rs 410 which is now a crucial level to watch for.With yesterday's 5 percent gain, the stock has witnessed a good momentum along with a huge volume spurt which signals increased participation near the major support zone.The stock has also recaptured its 100-day simple moving average at Rs 433 which is a positive sign.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not that of the website or its management.
