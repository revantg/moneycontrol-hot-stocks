In this process, it managed to convincingly traverse two key moving averages - 89-day exponential moving average and 200-day simple moving average along with more than average daily volumes.We recommend going long on a small dip towards Rs 4,750 for a target of Rs 5,100.Bajaj Finance | Sell | LTP: Rs 4,878 | Target price: Rs 4,600 | Stop loss: Rs 5,010 | Downside: 6%The financial space has been the real drag for the last one-and-a-half month.For the last few days, this stock has been hovering around its 89-day exponential moving average on the daily chart.Last Friday, the stock failed to hold its support as we witnessed a decisive breakdown below Rs 4,900.Looking at this price development, further weakness in the coming days cannot be ruled out.(The author is Chief Technical &amp;amp;amp; Derivatives Analyst at Angel Broking)Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not that of the website or its management.
