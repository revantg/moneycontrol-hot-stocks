From the high of August 3, Nifty is 2 percent higher while the smallcap index has nosedived 10 percent.So, the breadth of the market has deteriorated in the last two weeks.Many small and midcap stocks have witnessed a correction of more than 20 percent from the monthly high.While the Nifty is just a couple of percentages away from its all-time high of 16,700, the small and midcap indices are failing to sustain at higher levels.The Nifty Smallcap index has breached its 50-day exponential moving average (EMA) for the first time since April 2020.Last week, the Nifty Midcap index gave a bearish breakout from the head and shoulder pattern on the daily line charts which indicates more downside in the index.The reason behind Nifty's outperformance is - the support coming from select largecap IT, FMCG and telecom stocks.These stocks and sectors can still outperform.Therefore, it is advisable to stick to largecap stocks for short-term trading instead of anticipating bottoms in the smaller stocks.There could be pullbacks in small stocks due to oversold conditions on short-term charts, but it would be wise to use those opportunities to lighten the commitments.Nifty has not even violated its 10 and 20-day EMA supports which indicates that the trend of the benchmark index is still bullish on all timeframes.Immediate support zone for the index is at 16,300-16,350, followed by 15,900-16,000 zone.The primary trend of the Nifty is bullish till it holds above the 15,900 mark. Any level above 16,700 would further negate the possibility of a bearish trend reversal in the Nifty.Here are three buy calls for the next 3-4 weeks:Schaeffler India | LTP: Rs 6,989 | Target price: Rs 8,150 | Stop loss: Rs 6,400 | Upside: 17%The flag pattern breakout is seen on the daily chart of the stock.
