Upside targets for Nifty are seen at 15,300 and 15,450.Metals, real estate, cement and infra are the sectors in which investors should park their money in a phased manner.We expect mid-cap and small-cap indices to continue their outperformance over Nifty.Here are three buy calls for the next 3-4 weeks:Fortis Healthcare | Buy | LTP: Rs 185.85 | Target price: Rs 215 | Stop loss: Rs 168 | Upside: 16%There are few sessions left to complete the entire quarter and so far, this is the highest quarterly close for Fortis.There are good chances that it will confirm this breakout by sustaining above Rs 183 odd levels by the end of March.On the week ended March 5, 2021, this stock broke out from a bullish flag pattern on the weekly charts with higher volumes.It has been trading above all important moving averages. Indicators and oscillators like RSI, MACD and DMI have turned bullish on the short-term charts.Edelweiss Financial Services | LTP: Rs 85.75 | Target price: Rs 99 | Stop loss: Rs 77 | Upside: 15%This stock has taken out the crucial double top resistance placed at Rs 84 on the weekly charts.Volumes during the breakout remained significantly higher as compared to previous weeks.
