On the Put side, good participation is seen at 16,000 strike. The broader range of the index may be 16,000-16,500.RSI plotted on the weekly timeframe remains above the 50-mark and is drifting higher towards the overbought level, indicating that the bulls are attempting to take control of the trend.We expect the bullish momentum to continue and take the prices higher towards 16,500 (50 percent extension level of the rise from 10,790-15,431, projected from the 14,151-mark).If it manages to breach above 16,500, we might see it move higher towards 17,019 (61.8 percent extension level of the rise from 10,790-15,431, projected from the 14,151-mark).Here are three buy calls for the next two-three weeks:Tech Mahindra | LTP: Rs 1,386 | Target price: Rs 1,525 | Stop loss: Rs 1,266 | Upside: 10%Key resistance levels to watch out for is Rs 1,394 (78.6 percent extension level of the rise from Rs 471.40-1,081.55, projected from Rs 915), followed by Rs 1,525 (100 percent extension level of the rise from Rs 471.40-1,081.55, projected from Rs 915).The breakout level of Rs 1,266 (weekly low) will act as a red flag level, followed by Rs 1,085 (multiple touchpoint level and the breakout level).If the stock breaches Rs 1,394 on the upside, we may see it head higher towards Rs 1,525. If it falls and stays below Rs 1,266, it can fall further till Rs 1,085.HDFC | LTP: Rs 2,665.15 | Target price: Rs 2,990 | Stop loss: Rs 2,600 | Upside: 12%Key resistance levels to watch out for are Rs 2,840-2,896 (38.2 percent extension level of the rise from Rs 1,623-2,896, projected from Rs 2,354 and previous swing high), followed by Rs 2,990 (50 percent extension level of the rise from Rs 1,623-2,896, projected from Rs 2,354).The breakout level of Rs 2,600 (weekly low) will act as a red flag level, followed by Rs 2,516 (20-week SMA).HDFC, on the medium-term charts, seems to be breaking out of a multi-month resistance level. This up move is backed by rising volume, indicating participation in the breakout.If the stock breaches Rs 2,896 on the upside, we may see it head higher towards Rs 2,990.
