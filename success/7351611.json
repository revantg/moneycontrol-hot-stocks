On the derivative front, once again call writers were seen shifting towards higher bands while put writers added hefty open interest at 16,500 strikes.On the technical front, the 16,800 levels would act as strong resistance for the Nifty while bias is likely to remain in favour of bulls in the upcoming sessions as well.However, the banking index is facing a strong hurdle in the range of 36,000-36,400 zone above which we expect the index could continue its journey towards 37,000-levels in the coming weeks.Here is a list of top trading ideas for the next 3-4 weeks:Reliance Industries: Buy| LTP: Rs 2,163| Target: Rs 2,373| Stop Loss: Rs 2,020| Upside 10%In last two months, the stock&nbsp;has&nbsp;been fluctuating in a broader range of Rs 2,050-2,150 with prices holding well above its 200-days exponential moving average on a daily interval.The stock has managed to surpass above Rs&nbsp;2,150 levels this week after a prolonged consolidation.

It has been&nbsp;fluctuating in a broader range of Rs&nbsp;2,850-3,050 since last month.However, the&nbsp;stock price is holding well above its 200-days exponential moving average on daily charts.
