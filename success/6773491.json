On the Put side, open interest addition and participation are seen at 14,300 and 14,000 Put contracts.Thus, going ahead, we can expect Nifty's&nbsp;broader range to be between 15,000 and 14,000.The ADX plotted on the weekly timeframe can be seen moving lower, indicating a lack of strength, as the index moves in a sideways range.On the upside, 14,616 will act as a make-or-break level. If the index manages to move above this level, we may see the index move higher towards 15,000-15,050 and eventually towards 15,220.Key support levels to watch out for in the shortterm are 14,248 (weekly low), followed by 13,660 (38.2 percent retracement level of the rise from 10,790-15,431).If the index breaches and closes below 14,248, it can test 13,660.Here are three buy calls for the next three-four weeks:IPCA Laboratories | LTP: Rs 2,100 | Target price: Rs 2,783 | Stop loss: Rs 2,020 | Upside: 33%This stock, on the monthly timeframe, can be seen moving higher after bouncing off the Rs 1,785-mark.On the weekly timeframe, we can see that the stock broke above the upper range of the nine-week consolidation and the 20-week SMA and tested a high of Rs 2,215.On the indicator front, RSI plotted on the weekly timeframe can be seen placed above the 50-mark and moving higher.The immediate resistance is placed at Rs 2,416-2,460 (38.2 percent extension level of the rise from Rs 844-Rs 2,460 projected from Rs 1,785 and previous swing high) followed by Rs 2,783 (61.8 percent extension level of the rise from Rs 844-Rs 2,460 projected from Rs 1,785).The key support levels are Rs 2,020 (multiple touchpoint level) followed by Rs 1,785 (recent swing low).We expect the stock to move higher and test the Rs 2,460-mark.
