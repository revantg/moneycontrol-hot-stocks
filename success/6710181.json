However, due to profit-booking it retraced to Rs 920 and took support at its 50-day exponential moving average (DEMA) on the daily interval.On the technical front, the stock made a double bottom pattern around Rs 920 and once again gained momentum above its short-term moving averages.Additionally, the stock has also managed to give a breakout above symmetrical triangle pattern on the short-term charts.Positive divergences on secondary oscillators suggest the next up-move in the prices.Traders can accumulate the stock in the range of Rs 980-985 levels for the upside target of Rs 1,100.Berger Paints India | LTP: Rs 759.80 | Target price: Rs 854 | Stop loss: Rs 700 | Upside: 12%After taking support at its 100-day exponential moving average on the daily charts at around Rs 700, the stock witnessed a sharp up-move towards Rs 760 in a short span of time.However, the stock has been consolidating in a broader range of Rs 730-760 since then. It is holding well above its short and long-term moving averages on the daily and weekly intervals.At the current juncture, the stock has formed a triple bottom pattern on the daily charts and is on the verge of a fresh breakout above the pattern formation.Traders can accumulate the stock in the range of Rs 755-760 for the upside target of Rs 854.Marico | LTP: Rs 408.75 | Target price: Rs 446 | Stop loss: Rs 380 | Upside: 9%After testing a 52-week high of Rs 433.95 in February 2021, the stock slipped sharply towards Rs 380 due to profit-booking at higher levels.However, it took support at its 200-DEMA on the daily interval and saw a V-shaped recovery from there on to regain momentum above Rs 400.The stock has formed a rectangle pattern on the daily interval as prices were seen consolidating in the Rs 395-405 range after a rally from Rs 380.The price-volume action around the breakout level suggests an upswing in the prices. Traders can accumulate the stock in the range of Rs 405-409 for the upside target of Rs 446.(The author is Senior Technical Analyst at SMC Global Securities)Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.
