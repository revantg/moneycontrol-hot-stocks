The Nifty50 has been trading above the 20 and 50-day EMA, which gives further evidence of an uptrend.With intermediate and long-term momentum readings like 14-week and 14-month RSI in rising mode and not showing any signs of negative divergence, we expect the uptrend to continue.The slope of Daily ADX for Nifty is rising, which indicates that the index could gain momentum in the near term.In the Options segment, we have seen Put writing at 15,200-15,400 levels. During the last correction, the Nifty has found support at 16,163 and then bounced back.This level coincides with the 20-day EMA which is currently placed at 16,150 odd levels. Therefore, we believe that the short-term trend will remain intact till Nifty is trading above 16,150 levels.While we remain open to further upsides, a short-term trend reversal would be confirmed only if the Nifty closes below the 16150.The immediate targets for the Nifty is seen around 16,700-16,800 level, at which we have seen call writing. Far resistance is seen around 17,100 levels.During the last week, Bank Nifty has broken out on the weekly chart by surpassing the previous resistance of 36,134 levels.Private Banks, PSU Banks, and NBFC space should be on the radar for getting higher returns in the coming days.

We expect momentum buying to continue for the coming weeks.The next upside target of Nifty50 is seen around 16,800 levels, followed by 17,100. Longs should be protected by placing a stop loss placed below 16,150 in Nifty and 35,400 in the Bank Nifty.Here are three buy recommendations for the next 2-3 weeks:GSPL: Buy| LTP: Rs 358| Target: Rs 410| Stop-Loss: Rs 330| Upside 14%The stock price has broken out on the daily line chart to close at an all-time high level.
